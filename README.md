## About The Project
Raven Messenger is a proof-of-concept serverless chat application. This project provides a way to consume the Raven Web APIs from the command line.

### Text-based User Interface (TUI)

The text-based user interface lets you browse and send messages like you would in a web browser. 

### Command Line Interface (CLI) 
*_Under Construction_ *

The goal of the CLI is to provide programmatic access to Raven's messages and rooms. This is geared towards making it easier to integrate a chatbot into the platform.
